This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in C++: dangling pointers.  The `bug.cpp` file shows how reassigning a pointer after it's been used to modify a variable leads to undefined behavior.  The `bugSolution.cpp` offers a solution to this problem.  Undefined behavior can manifest in many ways (incorrect output, crashes, etc), making it difficult to debug.  Understanding proper memory management and pointer usage is crucial to avoid such issues in C++.
